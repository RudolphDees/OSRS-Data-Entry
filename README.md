# OSRS-Data-Entry

  Old School Runescape, also known as OSRS, is a MMORPG where players develope and level up a character along with other players. There is an activity known as Birdhouse Runs where the player visits 4 different birdhouses that they filled with seeds. When they empty each birdhouse they are rewarded with a random amout of bird nests which are pretty valuable in the game. There are 4 different types of nests: Empty Nests, Ring Nests, Seed Nests, and Clue Nests. Empty Nests are slef explanitory. Ring nests contain a random piece of jewelry but arent worth tracking. Seed Nests contain a random seed, some of which are extremely valuable. Clue Nests contain a random clue scroll that isn't worth explaining.
  
  This project is a C# Windows Form Application that connects to my mySQL server. It contains two tables, one that tracks the amount and type of nests I recieve and one that tracks the kinds of seeds I recieved.
